          It is important the queen (a term commonly used for a female cat that is either pregnant or nursing) directly nurse her young if possible. Monitor your kittenâ€™s growth closely to make sure its growth rate is progressing steadily. If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate, a caretaker might need to feed the kitten directly either with a bottle or a feeding tube.

          Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight appropriately include the following:

          <ul>
            <li>too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk</li>
            <li>gastrointestinal disease
            </li>
            <li>environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions</li>
